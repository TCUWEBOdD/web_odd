WORLD STATISTICS CONGRESSES  
  
The World Statistics Congresses occur every other year at a different city/venue each time. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 63rd WSC, which was planned for The Hague, will now be fully virtual from 11-16 July 2021. For more information on the WSC 2021, please visit the home page or other menu items displayed above.

  
The ISI World Statistics Congresses (WSC) take place once every two years in different countries. Though organized by the ISI, we work closely with the country's National Statistics Office and Society. The WSCs and their associated events are the highpoint of activities of the ISI where all our Associations, Committees, members and participants involved in statistics worldwide come together to participate in the many different activities and highlights of the WSC for an entire week and associated activities immediately before or after this week.

  
Each WSC has a rich Scientific Programme which is grouped into three types of sessions: invited paper sessions (IPS), special topic sessions (STS) and contributed and posters sessions (CPS). A full Administrative Programme includes meetings of the Executive Committees, Councils, General Assemblies and Committees of the ISI and the Associations, and special interest meetings relevant to the particular WSC. The Social Programme makes the WSC an event to remember and gives participants a flavour of the culture of the host country. The Social Programme also includes daytime activities for accompanying persons.

  
Associated with the WSC are Satellite Meetings and Short Courses of the ISI and the Associations. These take place in or close to the host city before and after the main WSC week and combine with the WSC to provide an overall outstanding international statistical event which is memorable in every way.
