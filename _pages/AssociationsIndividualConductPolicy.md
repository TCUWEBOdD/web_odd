#### **Expected behaviour**

In accordance with ISI Community Principles, it is the policy of ISI, ISI Associations and all ISI groups, that all members of ISI and ISI Associations and all participants in ISI and ISI Association activities will engage responsibly in a professional and productive environment free from discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Debate is recognised and welcomed as a critical part of professional activities but all members and all participants in ISI and Association events are expected to display respect, professionalism and courtesy towards all other members and participants.

#### **Unacceptable behaviour**

Threatening physical or verbal actions and disorderly or disruptive conduct will not be tolerated. Harassment or disrespectful behaviour towards individuals or groups - including verbal or textual comments relating to gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, age, national origin, politics, culture, gender identity or expression, or offensive images in public spaces - deliberate intimidation, stalking, unauthorized or inappropriate photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention, will not be tolerated. All members and individuals participating in ISI and ISI Association events must comply with these standards of behaviour.

All participants in ISI and ISI Association events also agree to comply with all rules and conditions of the events. This policy applies to all participants in such events, including but not limited to attendees, students, guests, staff, contractors, exhibitors, and participants in scientific sessions and official social activities of any such event.

#### **Procedures for reporting a violation**

**Conduct within an ISI or ISI Association meeting**

All event participants are expected to work proactively to promote good professional conduct, prevent unacceptable behaviour and to help each other to resolve violations if they occur. Minor concerns can often be resolved by discussion with the alleged perpetrator.

For each ISI or ISI Association event, there will be one or two designated persons (two for a WSC) to whom violations can be reported. Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of a violation should bring it to the attention of these designated officers. Violations may also be reported to the organizer of the event.

For each ISI and ISI Association event, this policy will be displayed on the event website, and included in all participants’ information packs. The latter will include the names of the designated representatives.

A violation during a meeting may also be reported after the meeting. In this case, the report should be made to the ISI Director and/or President.

**Conduct by ISI or ISI Association members outside ISI and ISI Association meetings.**

All members are expected to work proactively to promote good professional conduct, prevent unacceptable behaviour and to help each other to resolve violations if they occur. Minor concerns can often be resolved by discussion with the alleged perpetrator.

Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of a violation of this conduct policy is encouraged to bring it to the attention of the ISI Director and/or President.

#### **Procedures for acting on a report**

**Conduct within an ISI or ISI Association meeting**

**A report during the meeting**

In the case of minor concerns, the designated officers may choose to issue a warning. If the concern is not minor, the designated officers will request or provide a written report of the alleged violation, will interview the participant named as the alleged perpetrator, and will report to the ISI President, the Association President if applicable, and the Chair of the event. ISI will ensure careful and objective review of such reports, and take care to impose actions that are in proportion to the offense(s), that consider the professional and personal implications for all parties involved, and that further ISI’s Community Principles. At ISI's sole discretion, unacceptable behaviour may result in removal or denial of access to some or all of event facilities or activities, without refund of any applicable registration fees or costs. Serious violations may be reported to the relevant authorities.

**A report after the meeting**

Reports of violations during a meeting, but made after the meeting, should be made to the ISI Director and/or President. The Director and/or President will report to the ISI Executive who will ensure careful and objective review of such reports, and take care to impose actions that are in proportion to the offense(s), that consider the professional and personal implications for all parties involved, and that further ISI’s Community Principles. At ISI's sole discretion, unacceptable behaviour at meetings may result in denial of access to some or all of future event facilities or activities. Serious violations may be reported to the relevant authorities.

**Conduct by ISI or ISI Association members.**

Alleged breaches of this conduct policy by ISI or ISI Association members should be reported to the ISI Director and/or President who shall report to the ISI Executive. The procedure(s) for acting on the report will depend on the nature of the alleged breach, noting the diversity and sensitivities of unacceptable behaviour in an international context, and may include one or more of the following:

-   Appointment of a mediator, appropriate for the situation, to work with the affected member(s) and the alleged perpetrators of the breach, to achieve resolution of the problem. The mediator will report confidentially to the ISI Executive.
-   Appointment of a Review Committee to receive and consider confidential reports from the affected member(s) and the alleged member(s) in breach. Conduct reviews will be conducted with professionalism and fairness to all parties, and any mitigating or aggravating factors that are brought to the attention of the reviewer(s) will be considered. The Review Committee will report to the ISI Executive.
-   Referral to a third party ombudsman or other party.

In accordance with Statute 3.6 d), if the Executive Committee determines that an individual, organisational or affiliated member has acted in a way that contravenes the Statutes or is detrimental to the objectives of the ISI, the Executive Committee may terminate the membership.

In accordance with Statute 3.6 e), the member may appeal the decision to the Council within four weeks of receipt of the decision. The Council shall make a final decision according to the provisions in the By-laws.
